                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I’m Aaron Rinion, an IT student and video editor who creates visual content purely for fun and as a hobby. 
                   Driven by a passion for creativity, I focus on exploring and experimenting with IT skills and video editing to constantly 
                   improve my skills and produce engaging visuals.</p>

                <h3>My History</h3>
                <p>I’ve had a passion for creating visual content since I was 15 years old. 
                    I started exploring video editing at a young age, diving into the world of visuals with great enthusiasm. 
                    However, when I turned 16, I faced a setback due to a lack of the necessary equipment to continue creating the content I loved. 
                    This caused me to step away from my craft for a couple of years. Despite this break, my passion never faded. 
                    At 18, I took the course of IT and still studying and I was able to resume my work, armed with better tools and a renewed drive to continue creating compelling visual content. 
                    Since then, I’ve been honing my skills and pushing the boundaries of my creativity.</p>
